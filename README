Send group information tom Grouper via JSON web services.

SakaiOAE (nakamura) emits OSGi events for Authorizable objects. 
The GrouperJMSMessageProducer is notified of OSGi events and adds them to a JMS queue as messages.
The GrouperJMSMessageConsumer listens for JMS Messages on that queue and makes calls to a GrouperManager.
The GrouperManagerImpl sends HTTP POSTs to Grouper web services to add/remove groups and group memberships.
If the message has been successfully processed it is removed from the queue and we proceed to the next message.

When we add a group in sakai we also create a group in grouper. We store a property on the Authorizable
grouper:name => stema:stemb:stemc:groupname. Unfortunately this causes another authorizables/UPDATED event to
fire. To get around this we filter out messages caused by a specific user. In testing we've used grouper-admin.

YOu create the grouper-admin user like any other sakai user. Then you add it to the administrators group to
give it administrative access to SakaiOAE.

curl -uadmin:ADMIN_PASSWORD -F:member=grouper-admin \
